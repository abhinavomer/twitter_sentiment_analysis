# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Trained on 1.6 million tweets

## Overview

Twitter sentiment analysis is the process of analyzing and categorizing tweets (short text messages) posted on Twitter to determine the sentiment expressed in each tweet, such as positive, negative, or neutral. This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model using machine learning techniques to predict the sentiment of tweets.

## Project Description

The project involves the following components:

1. **Input**: Users can input a tweet into the provided text input field.
2. **Model Prediction**: Upon clicking the "Predict" button, the input tweet is processed using a pre-trained sentiment analysis model.
3. **Output**: The model predicts the sentiment of the input tweet as either positive or negative and displays the result to the user.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: An open-source Python library used for building interactive web applications.
- **Pickle**: Python's serialization module used for saving and loading machine learning models.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries**: Libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) or SpaCy may have been used for text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization and text vectorization.
- **Machine Learning Model**: A machine learning model, such as Logistic Regression trained on labeled tweet data to perform sentiment analysis.

## Usage

1. **Input Tweet**: Enter a tweet in the provided text input field.
2. **Prediction**: Click the "Predict" button to analyze the sentiment of the input tweet.
3. **Output**: The model predicts whether the sentiment of the tweet is positive or negative and displays the result to the user.
